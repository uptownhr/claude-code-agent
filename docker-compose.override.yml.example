# docker-compose.override.yml.example
# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml to customize the agent behavior

services:
  claude-agent:
    # Override the default command to run a different execution method

    # Option 1: CLI approach (one-shot)
    # command: ["claude", "--dangerously-skip-permissions", "-p", "your custom prompt here"]

    # Option 2: SDK approach (one-shot)
    # command: ["node", "agent.js", "your custom prompt here"]

    # Option 3: Interactive chat (multi-turn)
    # command: ["node", "chat.js"]
    # Note: For interactive chat, you may also want to use stdin_open and tty:
    # stdin_open: true
    # tty: true

    # Optional: Override environment variables
    # environment:
    #   - DEBUG=true

    # Optional: Mount additional volumes
    # volumes:
